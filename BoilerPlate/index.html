        <h1>Who Is He?</h1>
        <p> My name is Illerra Suerte. I am a <strong>self-taught</strong> coder.</p>
        <p> After numerous attempts to learn and build projects with Python I finially decided that
            I could no longer handle the failures of not building anything with that language.</p>
        <p> Instead, I focused on web development to learn how to make grand websites and then implemnt <em>Python</em> as my backend language</p>
